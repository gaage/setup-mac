# How to Add SSH Public Key to Server
#

In the ~/.ssh directory, generate private and public keys:
$ ssh-keygen -b 1024 -t rsa -f id_rsa 
This may be done with or without giving a password.

Add the private key to your local machine:
$ ssh-add id_rsa
(prompts you for the password, if you gave it)

Add the public key to the remote node:
$ ssh-copy-id -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub user@67.67.67.67
(prompts you for the remote node's password)
